# attempt-1

This was my first attempt at making this website. A couple of issues:
1. I didn't like the final design. At all.
2. Multiple CSS files is generally bad because it'll require multiple requests to load. A better solution would be to have everything in one CSS file, or use something like SASS or LESS to bundle multiple CSS files into one.
